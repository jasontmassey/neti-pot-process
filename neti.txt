= Jason's Neti Pot Process

== Background

I have endured more than thirty years of sinus infections and two sinus surgeries.
During my cigarette-smoking years, I would experience at least two sinus infections annually.
After quitting smoking, I would still get one and perhaps two sinus infections per year.
Circa 2017, while being treated for sinusitis, my doctor recommended I sample a "`neti pot`" to see if it improved symptoms.

I was so sick of treating sinus infections by this point that I was willing to try anything.
(And now that I understand the harm that antibiotics did to my gut flora,
I wish I had come across this amazing solution when I was in my late teens.)
So, I proceeded to introduce a neti pot into my life -- little did I know how drastic of a positive influence it would have.

Although weird, messy, and just plain strange as it was at the beginning,
it *substantially* alleviated the sinusitis symptoms.
Not only so, but I came to find it a thoroughly refreshing and enjoyable experience in its own right.
Oh, and one last detail of interest:
*I have not had a single sinus infection since I started this daily practice.*

Since becoming a zealous disciple of "`netipottery`" (my soon-to-be-popular word for the practice),
I find myself earnestly spreading the gospel of this life-changing and efficacious sacrament.
After being asked a few times what my personal routine looks like,
I decided to author this brief article.

== Materials

WARNING: Use *only* distilled water, otherwise microbes will eat your brain.

I prefer the CVS branded plastic/rubber neti pot:

As for saline rinse, I prefer the Neilmed sinus rinse packets:

If the Neilmed packets aren't available at CVS or Amazon,
then I use the CVS branded saline packets:

== Procedure

TIP: I recommend this as a *daily* procedure.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure --
my performing this procedure on a daily basis has kept me sinusitis-free for over three years.

== Comments

* In the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX8HyjZsq_o[video illustration],
the actress stops halfway through her pot to switch nostrils.
In my process, I pour an *entire* pot through each nostril.
* I heat my pot on high for 30s.
You may choose a different setting to meet your comfort needs.
